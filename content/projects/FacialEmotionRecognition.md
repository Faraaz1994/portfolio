-	Built an emotion recognition system that classifies the emotion displayed by the person in the
image into happy, angry, sad, neutral, surprise, disgust or fear.
-	Extracted SIFT features from the images to form the feature vector.
-	Constructed Bag Of Visual Words from the extracted SIFT features.
-	Used Keras to build the Convolutional Neural Network.
-	Trained the model on FER-2013 dataset.
